# Women in Congress - Analysis

When you begin to look at the demographics of Congress, one of the first things that stands out is that minorities have significantly less representation in comparison to causasion males. Despite this discrepency, a question that I wanted to answer is this: Regarding women in Congress, what is the overall trend? Further, how does that trend break down when we compare political parties over time? This project takes a look at the data and attempts to answer these questions.
